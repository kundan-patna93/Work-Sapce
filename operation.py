In this example, the Python function `append_text_to_file` appends the given `text_to_append` to the specified `file_path`. It opens the file in 'a' (append) mode, writes the text followed by a newline, and prints a success message. If any error occurs during the process, it prints an error message. The example usage demonstrates appending the specified text to the file 'example.txt'.
